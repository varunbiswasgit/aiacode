# Clean WhatsApp Chat Export Script

## Overview
The `Clean_data_whatsapp.ps1` script is designed to process WhatsApp chat exports saved as text files. It cleans and structures unorganized text data, enabling users to easily import it into tools like Excel for advanced querying and table creation.

While optimized for WhatsApp chats, this script can also be used for other generic purposes, such as cleaning up and structuring logs or text files that follow a similar timestamp-based format.

---

## Key Features
1. **Date and Time Detection:**
   - Matches messages based on timestamps using a regular expression (e.g., `[1/12/23, 9:45:00 PM]`).
   - Groups' messages with their associated participants.

2. **Unicode Character Handling:**
   - Removes problematic characters, such as `Left-to-Right Mark (LRM)` and unusual spaces, for better readability.

3. **Multi-line Message Support:**
   - Combines broken multi-line messages into a single line, maintaining proper structure.

4. **Tab-Separated Output:**
   - Saves cleaned data in a tab-separated format for easy import into Excel or other tools.
